# Builder of apps.

- Estimated time till completion is 3days and then i need to go into open source, which is the new exciting step for me.
- To build the app with tailwind already configure I used `npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss my-project` from
 https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs#install-tailwind-via-npm, then agred to the prompts ofcourse.
- Then i created a new app folder in the root so that i can update to next.js 13 to do that check out
 https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/experimental-app-dir-config.
- imported tailwind `import '../styles/globals.css';` to the layout.tsx, then delete the index.tsx because of the conflict,
which arrises from terminal.
- every component in app(folder) is a server component.
- server components are not allowed to use hooks
- 'use client' changes component from server-client.
- Registerd in the Github global student and i now have access to copilot and got the gitlens extension
- For the error : Module not found: Can't resolve 'encoding' in.... , you can use `npm add encoding`.
- Just solved for a BUG and the bugRush is real, feeling great right now. I just realised as i'm writing this that 
probably no one will read this i'm just taking up space in the cloud storage. Does these action qualify me as an 
invader/coloniser of some sort because if you were to count all the cloud storage up there and see diagramatically
who has contributed what I think that will be an exciting human measurement, definetly better than this trash thing 
we call money.
- Owk back to the bug, the thing was keywords insteasd of Keywords, how sweat. chatGPT was really useful this time
around.

- installed line clamp https://tailwindcss.com/blog/multi-line-truncation-with-tailwindcss-line-clamp
rather than trancuate which is only for one line. lineclamp is user friendly.
- I need to have news with images and save those as my hard data.
- Use `control P` to find and jump to file.
- Created a tag. with the idea to checkout how they work and get used to 'em.

# During this build, I learnt: 
- I gained expertise in handling dynamic data to ensure that the app's content remains current and relevant for users.
- I explored the latest version of Nex JS, version 13, and its potential applications for building cutting-edge apps.
- I deepened my understanding of GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, and utilized Stepzen to generate GraphQL data from their site, which allowed me to create data-driven applications that provide users with personalized and real-time information.
- My proficiency in Tailwind CSS has reached an advanced level, which will enable me to create visually appealing and responsive designs for my upcoming projects.
- Overall, the skills and knowledge I have gained through this project will undoubtedly benefit me in building future apps that meet the needs and expectations of my users.
