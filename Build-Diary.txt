Builder of apps.

estimated time till completion is 3days and then i need to go into open source, which is the new exciting step for me.
to buildthe app with tailwind already configure I used (npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss my-project) from
(https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs#install-tailwind-via-npm), then agred to the prompts ofcourse.
then i created a new app folder in the root so that i can update to next.js 13 to do that check out
(https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/experimental-app-dir-config).
import tailwind (import '../styles/globals.css';) to the layout.tsx, then delete the index.tsx because of the conflict,
which arrises from terminal.

every component in app(folder) is a server component.
server components are not allowed to use hooks, 'use client' changes component from server-client.

-registerdin the Github global student and i now have access to copilot.
and got the gitlens extension
