Builder of apps.

estimated time till completion is 3days and then i need to go into open source, which is the new exciting step for me.
to buildthe app with tailwind already configure I used (npx create-next-app -e with-tailwindcss my-project) from
(https://v2.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs#install-tailwind-via-npm), then agred to the prompts ofcourse.
then i created a new app folder in the root so that i can update to next.js 13 to do that check out
(https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/experimental-app-dir-config).
import tailwind (import '../styles/globals.css';) to the layout.tsx, then delete the index.tsx because of the conflict,
which arrises from terminal.

every component in app(folder) is a server component.
server components are not allowed to use hooks, 'use client' changes component from server-client.

-registerd in the Github global student and i now have access to copilot.
and got the gitlens extension
.for the error : Module not found: Can't resolve 'encoding' in , you can use npm add encoding.
.Just solved for a BUG and the bugRush is real, feeling great right now. I just realised as i'm writing this that 
probably no one will read this i'm just taking up space in the cloud storage. Does these action qualify me as an 
invader/coloniser of some sort because if you were to count all the cloud storage up there and see diagramatically
who has contributed what I think that will be an exciting human mwasurement, definetly better than this trash thing 
we call money.
.Owk back to the bug, the thing was keywords insteasd of Keywords, how sweat. chatGPT was really useful this time
around.

.installed line clamp (https://tailwindcss.com/blog/multi-line-truncation-with-tailwindcss-line-clamp)
rather than trancuate which is only for one line. lineclamp is user friendly.
.I need to have news with images and save those as my hard data.
.use control P to find and jump to file.
created a tag. with the idea to checkout how they work and get used to 'em.
